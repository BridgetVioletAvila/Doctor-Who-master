      <p>Madame Karabraxos</p>
      <p>To ensure the security of her bank and the loyalty of all her staff, Karabraxos <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Clone" title="Clone">cloned</a> herself several times, placing the clones in important positions within the bank. These clones, such as <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Delphox" title="Delphox">Ms. Delphox</a>, were totally obedient and lived in perpetual fear of their master, who had an unfortunate tendency to "fire" those who failed her. She did this by throwing them into the bank's incinerator.</p>
      <p>She also kept a fearsome beast known as <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Teller_(Time_Heist)" title="The Teller (Time Heist)">the Teller</a>, a telepathic creature which was able to detect and get rid of anyone attempting to break into the bank. Karabraxos kept the Teller in her control by keeping its mate, the only other of its kind left in the universe, in a cell below the bank.</p>
      <p>While in the position of bank manager, Madame Karabraxos lived in the bank's Private Vault, surrounded by all the wealth she had acquired over the years. At one point, however, a solar storm threatened to destroy the bank and all the wealth inside it. Inside her Vault, Karabraxos was accosted by the <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Twelfth_Doctor" title="Twelfth Doctor">Twelfth Doctor</a> and his companion <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Clara" title="Clara">Clara</a>, as well as <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Psi" title="Psi">Psi</a> and <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Saibra" title="Saibra">Saibra</a>, who had been instructed to carry out a heist. There, Karabraxos was informed of the dangers the solar storm posed to her and fled, gathering the best of her treasures into one small suitcase, leaving the robbers, as well as the Teller and its mate, to die. Just before she left, however, the Doctor gave her a piece of paper with a telephone number that would link directly to <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_TARDIS" title="The Doctor's TARDIS">his TARDIS</a> and the words, "I'm a time traveller".</p>
