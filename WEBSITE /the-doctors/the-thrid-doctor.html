      <h1>The Third Doctor</h1>
      <p> <img src="Images/The-3rd-Doctor.jpg" width="250" height="250" alt="The Third Doctor"></p>
      <p>The <strong>Third Doctor</strong> is an incarnation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who)" title="Doctor (Doctor Who)">the Doctor</a>, the protagonist of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television" title="Science fiction on television">science fiction television</a> series <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></em>. He was portrayed by actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Pertwee" title="Jon Pertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord" title="Time Lord">Time Lord</a> alien from the planet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey" title="Gallifrey">Gallifrey</a> who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction" title="Time travel in fiction">travels in time and space</a> in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS" title="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, frequently with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who)" title="Companion (Doctor Who)">companions</a>. When the Doctor is critically injured, his body can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who)" title="Regeneration (Doctor Who)">regenerate</a>; as a result, his physical appearance and personality change. Pertwee portrays the third such incarnation, a dapper man of action of stark contrast to his wily but less action-oriented predecessors. While previous Doctors' stories had all involved time and space travel, for production reasons Pertwee's stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth, where he worked as a scientific advisor to the international military group <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Intelligence_Taskforce" title="United Nations Intelligence Taskforce">UNIT</a>. His adventures often fitted into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy-fi" title="Spy-fi">spy-fi</a> genre which had been popularised by <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(TV_series)" title="The Avengers (TV series)">The Avengers</a></em> the decade prior. Within the story, the Third Doctor came into existence as part of a punishment from his own race, the Time Lords, who forced him to regenerate and also disabled his TARDIS. Eventually, this restriction is lifted and the Third Doctor embarks on more traditional time travel and space exploration stories. His initial companion is UNIT scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Shaw" title="Liz Shaw">Liz Shaw</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_John" title="Caroline John">Caroline John</a>), who unceremoniously leaves the Doctor's company between episodes to be replaced by the more wide-eyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Grant" title="Jo Grant">Jo Grant</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Manning" title="Katy Manning">Katy Manning</a>), who then continues to accompany the Doctor after he regains use of his TARDIS. His final companion was intrepid journalist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jane_Smith" title="Sarah Jane Smith">Sarah Jane Smith</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Sladen" title="Elisabeth Sladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>), who would go on to become the Doctor's longest-serving companion. As part of his sentence from the Time Lords, the Doctor was forced to begin his exile on earth with a new face. The Third Doctor was confident, bold and brash, but with a soft paternal side, reserved for those he cared about. While exiled he became allied to the extraterrestrial taskforce UNIT and helped them combat living plastic Autons, Sea Devils and polluted giant green maggots, as well as fellow renegade Time Lord, The Master. Eventually he was allowed to travel again, and on one such trip received a fatal dose of radiation, prompting him to regenerate.</p>
